# Visualization Evaluation

In the sphere of data analysis, visualisation is very important, as it transforms raw data into a form that's much more easily understood, and hence it reaches an even bigger audience. Visualisations use visual cues: color, shape, size, to emphasize trends, patterns, and anomalies, making it easy to bring important insight very quickly to the attention of the user. 

Equally important is user evaluation for these visualisations, since it would ensure that the design is intuitive, relevant, and accessible to the proper audience. It allows analysts and designers to observe real users interacting with visualisations, gathering feedback on how clear, usable, and functional the visualization is. This testing helps identify possible usability problems, such as misinterpretation of data arising from confusing designs, poor choice of visualisation types and color schemes. Through iteration guided by user feedback, designers can further refine visualizations to better meet users' needs and improve their ability to understand and act upon insights derived from data. In the end, user-centered visualisations increase the overall communication effectiveness with data and achieve a greater understanding and trust of the data.

## Objective
The principal objective of this project is to conduct an experiment which aims to systematically investigate the effectiveness of heatmaps and scatterplots in visualising pupil absences across a hypothetical dataset encompassing ten schools over an academic year. By assessing participants accuracy, response time, and the ability to interpret the data, the research seeks to determine which method is able to portray the information about pupil absences with a greater impact.
